# awesome-energy-models

## What is this page about? 
This page is an attempt to catalogize and categorize open-source python-based models 
for planning and operations of energy systems. The focus is on frameworks, libraries ([frameworks vs libraries](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/148747/what-is-the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library)) 
and tutorials, over codes implementing specific energy model (e.g. accompanying a research paper). 
Even though projects with specific energy model implementations are included given the code quality is high. 

**Note**: Some things that are out of scope for this page include: IoT/connectivity projects, web/data scrapers, 
visualization tools and data models/ontologies. 

## Energy Model Categorization
The energy models are categorized according to several characteristics: code type, problem type, 
model type, energy assets included and scale. Here is an outline of all the characteristics and their 
meaning: 


| Characteristics   | Fields        |
| :---              | :---          |
| **Code type**     | 🧩 **Framework**: Defines concepts and components that are used to create a solution <br> 📚 **Library**: Functions and classes to solve a specific task, e.g. generating demand profiles. <br> 🎓 **Tutorial**: Educational walkthroughs of specific topics and concepts. <br> 📄 **Code**: Implementation of specific energy model. |
| **Problem type**  | 🎬 **Operations**: Operations problem such as dispatch or continuous trading. <br> 📝 **Planning**: Planning problems such as optimal investments or system configuration. |
| **Model type**    | 🎮 **Simulation**: Simulations of physical processes or behaviour, typically allowing for "what-if"-analysis. <br> 📝 **Prediction**: Forecasting and scenario generation. <br> ⚙️ **Optimization**: Models performing decision optimization. <br> 🤖 **Agents**: Models interacting with and learning from environments. |
| **Energy assets** | ☀️ **Solar**: Solar PV and solar thermal assets. <br> 🌬️ **Wind**: Wind turbines and wind farms. <br> 🔋 **Battery**: Electrochemical batteries. <br> 💦 **Hydro**: Electrochemical batteries. <br> 💦 **Heat pump**: <br> ⚡ **Heat pump**:  |
| **Energy assets** | ⚡ **Power transmission**: Scale of power transmission and countries. <br> 🏭 **Power plant**: Front-of-meter power plant scale. <br> 🏙️ **City/Region**: City or region scale. <br> 🏘️ **Community**: Energy community scale. <br> 🏠 **House/building**: House or building scale. <br> 🔋 **Asset**: Asset scale. |
